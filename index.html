            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">While some believe that the unplanned and rapid move to online learning – with no training, insufficient bandwidth, and little preparation – will result in a poor user experience that is unconducive to sustained growth, others believe that a new hybrid model of education will emerge, with significant benefits. “I believe that the integration of information technology in education will be further accelerated and that online education will eventually become an integral component of school education,“ says Wang Tao, Vice President of Tencent Cloud and Vice President of Tencent Education. For those who do have access to the right technology, there is evidence that learning online can be more effective in a number of ways. Some research shows that on average, students retain 25-60% more material when learning online compared to only 8-10% in a classroom. This is mostly due to the students being able to learn faster online; e-learning requires 40-60% less time to learn than in a traditional classroom setting because students can learn at their own pace, going back and re-reading, skipping, or accelerating through concepts as they choose. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of online learning varies amongst age groups. The general consensus on children, especially younger ones, is that a structured environment is required, because kids are more easily distracted. To get the full benefit of online learning, there needs to be a concerted effort to provide this structure and go beyond replicating a physical class/lecture through video capabilities, instead, using a range of collaboration tools and engagement methods that promote “inclusion, personalization and intelligence”, according to Dowson Tong, Senior Executive Vice President of Tencent and President of its Cloud and Smart Industries Group.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Online learning tools and platforms, with their customised offering, are addressing the challenges of access, quality, and constrained budgets. They are offering millions of students living in urban and rural areas an easy, affordable, and reliable way to learn.This will bring about more personalised and agile learning. Learners would be able to hear and see the various concepts that are being taught and will process them in a similar way during everyday interactions.Further, they assist in the learning process, particularly the complex topics that demand a great level of understanding. Reality technologies such as augmented reality (AR) enable this. With EdTech catching on, these new-age technologies can be widely adopted to increase stickiness. It has been noted that learning intertwined with immersive storytelling and real-life examples increases retention of concepts by 90 percent!The key trend of eLearning would include the need for up-skilling courses with curated and user-generated content, which has been in-demand with people learning and working remotely. This shall determine the most effective content that would match the student's needs efficiently, resulting in positive user engagement and therefore, an optimal outcome.As technology develops, these new trends will also develop, but the pillars around which it will advance would be customised learning, accessibility, engagement, and user-centric learning.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The concept of traditional education has changed radically within the last couple of years. Being physically present in a classroom isn’t the only learning option anymore — not with the rise of the internet and new technologies, at least. Nowadays, you have access to a quality education whenever and wherever you want, as long as you have access to a computer. We are now entering a new era — the revolution of online education.There’s no need to discount the skepticism surrounding education through the internet. It’s hard to understand the notion of leaving behind the conventional classroom, especially if it's to face this vast space called The Internet.Online education enables the teacher and the student to set their own learning pace, and there’s the added flexibility of setting a schedule that fits everyone’s agenda. As a result, using an online educational platform allows for a better balance of work and studies, so there’s no need to give anything up. Studying online teaches you vital time management skills, which makes finding a good work-study balance easier. Having a common agenda between the student and teacher can also prompt both parties to accept new responsibilities and have more autonomy.In a space as vast and wide as the internet, there are infinite skills and subjects to teach and learn. A growing number of universities and higher education schools are offering online versions of their programs for various levels and disciplines. From music composition to quantum physics, there are options for every type of student. Studying your program online is also a great option for getting an official certificate, diploma, or degree without physically setting foot on a university campus.</p>
